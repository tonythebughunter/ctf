# flag 0
The edit endpoint ie ./edit/1 has an idor. Bruteforce the parameter '1' and find there is page 4 ie edit/4 which has our first flag.

# flag 1
on markdown test ./page/edit/2, i realised the textarea is vulnerable to xss and on putting my xss payload in form of an event listener on the <img> tag ie {<img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54e8ba93e4b07c3f655b452e/t/56c2a04520c64707756f4267/1493764650017" onerror=alert()>} and the <button> tag ie {<button onclick=alert()>some button</button>}, boom i found the flag but its hidden in the DOM ie inspect or view source to see it otherwise you won't see it.

# flag 2
The title tag is also vulnerable to xss. So i used this payload to pop an xss '<svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>'. First i didn't see the pop up while on the page but it pops up when i go back to the home page.

# flag 3
After a long hunt for the final flag, I realised there is a potential of the site to be vulnerable to sqli so i tested every page with this payload '-- and boom the edit endpoint is vulnerable to sqli ie edit/1'
